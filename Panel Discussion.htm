		<strong>Abstract: </strong>The availability of enormous data triggers the rapid growth of big data processing on top of large-scale distributed systems. Researchers from both the industry and academia worked together to develop various kinds of technologies and systems. Almost every part of the computer system, such as file systems, data management systems, parallel computing engines and in-memory system technologies, faces intensive changing. Numerous concepts and models are proposed, accompanied by hundreds of new systems. Without a mature theoretical foundation, it is often difficult to identify the future trend of Bid Data in such a foggy cloud. In this panel, panelists from various areas of information retrieval and data mining, database system, networking, software engineering and Big Data application will discuss the state-of-the-art, challenges and the trend of big data. We would not attempt to draw a conclusion, but we expect to outline a vision from the fusion of ideas from different disciplines.<BR><BR>
