		<strong>Title:</strong>Mobile Cloud, Crowd and Fog Computing, Communications and Sensing<BR><BR>
      	<strong>Abstract:</strong><BR>
      	Mobile devices can serve as terminals for cloud computing services over intelligent network. ¡®Crowd computing¡¯ 
      	combines mobile devices and social interactions to achieve large-scale distributed computation. ¡®Fog computing¡¯ 
      	is a highly virtualized platform that provides compute, storage and networking services between end devices and 
      	traditional cloud computing data centers. Mobile devices are being equipped with various sensors to provide input 
      	for participatory and opportunistic crowd-sourced sensing. This talk gives overview of applications and the 
      	transmission, computation (e.g. task outsourcing), and sensing (e.g. location based services) challenges and 
      	solution approaches of green computing in mobile cloud. Examples include task farming and social network creation 
      	and cooperation. Particular emerging concepts are ¡®vehicular cloud/crowd¡¯, with applications such as vehicular data 
      	center and congestion mitigation.<BR><BR>

		<strong>Title:</strong>Programming Support for Big Data Applications<BR><BR>
      	<strong>Abstract:</strong><BR>
      	Big data is characterized by its volume, velocity and variety, and applies to information that exceeds the processing capacity of conventional database systems. It provides tremendous opportunities but also imposes great challenges. Among the others, how to provide effective and efficient support for programming with big data has attracted a lot of attentions from both researchers and practitioners. Various system platforms have been developed for big data management and processing. In this talk, I will focus on programming models for big data applications. I will describe the requirements and difficulties of developing big data processing platforms, review existing works, and briefly introduce approaches to tackle the challenging issues in big data programming.<BR><BR>
