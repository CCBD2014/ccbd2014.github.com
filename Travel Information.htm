      Yellow Crane Tower is a famous and historic tower, often rebuilt, that stands on Sheshan (Snake Hill), 
      at the bank of Yangtze River in the Wuchang District. Tourists can obtain a fine view of the Yangtze 
      River from the top of the tower. Yellow Crane Tower is considered one of the Four Great Towers of China. 
      It also enjoys the reputation of the "superb scenery in China" and "the top tower in the world". 
      In its modern version it has the appearance of an ancient tower but is built of modern materials 
      and includes an elevator. Displays are presented at each level. To the east on the hill, a large 
      temple bell may be struck by tourists for a small fee. <BR>

      Ancient Lute Terrace is located on the east bank of the Moon Lake near the western foot of the Tortoise Hill. 
      The terrace is also named Boya Terrace because of a famous story. A legend has it that a famous musician 
      in the Chu Kingdom, during the Spring and Autumn Period (770 B.C. - 476 B.C.), Yu Boya, once was playing 
      a piece of music here. A woodcutter, Zhong Ziqi, heard his music and understood quite well the message 
      conveyed in the music: high mountains and flowing water. Later the two became good friends. However, 
      when Yu Boya came back to this mountain several years later, he was extremely sad to know that Zhong 
      Ziqi had died of illness. Knowing that there would be no one else to appreciate the beauty of his music, 
      Yu Boya smashed his lute in grief and never again played music. Thus Ancient Lute Terrace was built 
      to memorize their friendship. Located on the east bank of the Moon Lake near the western foot of the 
      Tortoise Hill, the terrace boasts a quiet and beautiful scenery. Its profound cultural connotation 
      makes it a music cultural heritage of Wuhan as well as a provincial and national key cultural relic 
      protection unit.<BR>
