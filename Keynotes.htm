		<strong>Title:</strong>Programming Support for Big Data Applications<BR><BR>
      	<strong>Abstract:</strong><BR>
      	Big data is characterized by its volume, velocity and variety, and applies to information that exceeds the processing capacity of conventional database systems. It provides tremendous opportunities but also imposes great challenges. Among the others, how to provide effective and efficient support for programming with big data has attracted a lot of attentions from both researchers and practitioners. Various system platforms have been developed for big data management and processing. In this talk, I will focus on programming models for big data applications. I will describe the requirements and difficulties of developing big data processing platforms, review existing works, and briefly introduce approaches to tackle the challenging issues in big data programming.<BR><BR>
